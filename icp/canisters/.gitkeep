- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, you can add it by running `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

## Getting Started - Local replica

2. Clone this repository
3. Enter the newly created folder
4. Enter the ICP folder using `cd icp`
5. Download the declarations for the SIWE canister running `curl -o canisters/ic_siwe_provider.did -vL https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siwe/releases/download/v0.0.6/ic_siwe_provider.did`
6. Run `dfx generate` to generate the candid types
